Product Showcase Page:

This project is a Product Showcase Page for an online store. It includes a responsive grid layout, pagination controls, a product carousel, a sidebar with filtering options, and a contact form for user interactions.

Key Features
1. Responsive Grid Layout:
The product listing is displayed in a masonry-style grid layout that adjusts according to the screen size. The grid is responsive, providing an optimal view of products across various devices and screen sizes.

2. Product Carousel:
A carousel at the top of the page features rotating images of products (e.g., sale or featured products). The carousel uses CSS keyframe animations to slide images continuously​(styles)​(project1).

3. Sidebar with Toggle:
A sidebar containing product categories can be toggled open or closed with a button. This allows users to filter products based on categories, enhancing the browsing experience without cluttering the interface​(styles)​(project1).

4. Pagination Controls:
Pagination is provided at the bottom of the product grid to easily navigate between multiple pages of products. This helps manage large product catalogs efficiently​(project1).

5. Contact Form:
A contact form is available at the bottom of the page, where users can submit queries or contact the store. It includes fields for the user's name, email, and message​(styles)​(project1).

File Structure:

index.html: The main HTML file containing the product showcase page layout.
styles.css: The stylesheet for the page, including styling for the grid layout, carousel, pagination, sidebar, and contact form.


Technologies Used:
HTML5: For structuring the page and content.

CSS3: For styling the layout and implementing animations (e.g., the carousel and hover effects).

Responsive Design: The grid layout and other elements are fully responsive and adapt to various screen sizes.
